Purpose(s) of SdkPerf
 - It's a Solace test tool!  Used extensively by both our customers, our field staff (POCs, testing), and our QA department
 - Command-line app, wrapped around our various APIs
 - Programming/visibility/troubleshooting (dumping messages)
 - Load/performance testing
 - Latency testing
 - Comparison testing (slow app performance: baseline with API-specific SdkPerf first)
 - 
 


For command-line switches:
Equals required with C, either space or equals with JCSMP


Subscribing:
============

>            catch-all wildcard
#P2P/>	     receives typically-hidden messages, such as reply-tos, SolCache communication,
             any messages published to a queue (#P2P/QUE/... or #P2P/QTMP/...)
So, >,#P2P/> sees everything

When using Event Mesh (DMR) subscribing to > can be dangerous!  Sucks in messages from other brokers!
So use:  #noexport/>


BASICS:
=======
    -cip=ip[:port]  IP and port of the client appliance. (e.g. -cip=192.168.160.101)

    -cu=user[@vpn]  Client username and optionally VPN name.

    -cp=password    Client password (default '')

    -stl=list       List of topics for subscribing applied round robin to clients
	
    -md             Dump all received messages to the screen as text
	
    -ptl=list       List of topics for publishing. Note: This list must be
                    either of size 1 (same topic used for all msgs) or
                    of equal length to message parts specified (topics uniquely specified).

    -mn=number      Total # messages to publish (across ALL clients). (default is 0)

    -mr=number      Publishing rate (msg/sec per client) (default 1)

    -msa=list       Comma sep size list in bytes for auto-generated binary attachment
                    portion.
		    
    -q              Enable quiet mode.  No command line output during
    Java-only  

GUARANTEED:
===========
    -pql list       List of queues for publishing. Note: This list must be
                    either of size 1 (same queue used for all msgs) or
                    of equal length to message parts specified (queues uniquely specified).
					
    -sql list       List of queues for subscribing applied round robin to clients

    -mt=string      Message type, one of direct|nonpersistent|persistent}.


JMS:
====
    -jcf string     JMS Connection Factory (default /jms/cf/default)

    -jndi           Enable JNDI topic and queue lookups.
    

INTERMEDIATE:
=============
    -cc=number      Number of client connections (default 1)

    -pal=list       Binary attachment list.
	
    -qb             Enables queue browsing. Option must be used with '-sql'
    
    -cm=string      Client mode.  One of 'reply' or 'sink'.  Default is 'sink'.
                    In reply, all messages are reflected by the replyTo topic is used as the destination when sending.

    -prt            Publish reply topic flag. Pubs will add reply to topic in each send.  P2P by default.

    -sdl list       List of durable topic endpoints (DTE) for subscribing.  If using DTEs
                    and this param is omitted, topic names will be used as DTE names.

    -tte int        Number of temporary topic endpoints to create per client.
    -tqe int        Number of temporary queue endpoints to create per client.

    -z number       Enable compression. (1..9) 1 is fastest, 9 max compression.
        (need to connect to compressed port)


ADVANCED:
=========
    -apw=int        Set the publisher ack window size.  Valid range is 1 - 255
	
    -ptp string     Publish topic prefix. Use with -ptc to generate a large topic list.
    -ptc int        Publish topic count. Use with -ptp to generate a large topic list.

    -epl list       Comma sep list of extra Props passed blindly to the API

    -cpl            Custom Property List. This argument can be used to add custom Properties on messages being published.

                    In reply, all messages are reflected by the replyTo topic is used as the destination when sendin

    -sd=int         Per subscriber per msg delay in milliseconds. Ie slow subscribers.
                    Use -1 to stop the subscriber from responding to messages.
                    (default 0)


LATENCY TESTING:
================
    -l  flag        Enable latency measurements (default is no latency).
